- These are codes for regression models (simple linear, multilinear, and polynomial) with their math behind them.

- These methods' maths have been written as codes without using any other libraries. Only Python's fundamental libraries have been used. Pandas is used to import the dataset, Scipy is used to remove outliers, and Matplotlib is used to plot.

- Results have been compared with the models that Sklearn libraries have, and the results are so close to each other.
